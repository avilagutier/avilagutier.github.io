                          <h2>Autonomous Professional Development </h2>
                          <p>
                            In November 2019 I had my first approach to HTML, where I took a 5-day basic course to see if I was interested.
                            During the first confinement (Covid-19) in France, I tooked the formation in the principles of HTML5/CSS3 by the MOOC Open Class Room.
                            Besides the Open Class Rooms MOOC, I also followed <a href="https://grafikart.fr/" target="_blank">grafikart</a> and udemy MOOC. 
                            Having discussed with several PhD colleagues who were leaning towards a web development background, I was curious to know how
                            I could become a front-end or back-end developer. One of the first things was how to work with my Mac terminal, as well as how
                            to do my version control (Git) and upload my progress on GitHub. After visualizing different information for front-end development,
                            I opted to do a course in JavaScript and Node.js, which is on hold. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            During the job search period, I had the opportunity to attend the Data Job convention at the Cité de Science (Paris, France),
                            where I had the opportunity to learn about the different companies in the IT world, the programming languages required to apply
                            to the different companies. In this convention, I started to see the possibility of developing new skills in the field of data science
                            (something not so far from the data analysis obtained in my experiments during my PhD). After an exchange of ideas with the information Lab,
                            I discovered the use of DataViz with Tableau and Alteryx. Where I had the opportunity to get to know them a bit more in the discovery formations. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            After having asked different people which programming language is better for Data Science, I did an introductory training in Python,
                            which has led me to continue my training through different sites such as real python, medium or hackerrank. In June 2020,
                            I had an interview with an IT company specialized in statistics. In this interview, they proposed me to have more solid training
                            in Python and DataViz (Tableau or PoweBI) and complementing these formations with the R programming language. I was so motivated
                            in wanting to do such learning R, that I took the MOOC's of HarvardX and Anahuac University to obtain the first certificate,
                            although I continue training in that language, to generate more experience.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I currently have formations on standby, hoping to lighten my schedule a bit on my postdoctoral project, which is my priority.
